# Plugin Composer Exporter

The Plugin Composer Exporter for WordPress scans all installed plugins and exports their information to generate new `composer.json` definitions for active and inactive plugins. This tool is particularly useful for developers and site administrators looking to manage WordPress plugin dependencies via Composer.

## Features

- **Scan Installed Plugins**: Automatically detect all installed plugins in a WordPress installation.
- **Export Composer Definitions**: Generate `composer.json` files for active and inactive plugins, allowing for easy dependency management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a simple administrative backend UI for easy operation.
- **Selective Export**: Choose specific plugins for inclusion in the generated `composer.json` files.

## Installation
